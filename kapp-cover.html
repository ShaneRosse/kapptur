  	<p>&nbsp; I originally chose to study electrical engineering, inspired by the iPhone, to develop hardware.  After taking a course in iOS development and hacking on several independent projects I've found a true joy in programming iOS apps.  Additionally, I've taken on projects in various javascript frameworks, engineered solutions to optical character recognition and worked at the assembly level to see every layer of the computer stack and understand what I really enjoy doing.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; An internship at Kapptur would be a wonderful opportunity to collaborate with professional software engineers and drive forward Kapptur's mission of printing the world's photos.  I find the product particularly interesting and recognize the obvious need for an alternate photo printing service as we've transitioned to digital photography.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; I'm highy motivated to work full time this summer and would love to tackle a project at a smaller company.</p>
